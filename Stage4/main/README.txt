TO RUN THE PROGRAM: Everything under this directory file ('main') is the whole program. So long as its all organized under one folder, as it is here, it should run normally outside of an IDE. The higher-level organization and remaining files under Stage3 are IntelIJ files, used by Dustin as he set up the base program.
